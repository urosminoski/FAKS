    **Parameters:**

    x : ndarray
        The matrix to be padded.

    n : int
        The number of rows of the matrix after padding.

    val : scalar, optional
        The value to be used used for padding.

    .. note:: A 1-d array, for example ``a.shape == (N,)`` is reshaped to be
              a 1 column array: ``a.reshape((N, 1))``

    The empty matrix is assumed to be have 1 empty column.

    **Returns:**

    xp : 2-d ndarray
        The padded matrix.
