def partitionABCD(ABCD, m=None, r=None):
    """Partition ABCD into A, B, C, D for an m-input r-output system.

    The :math:`ABCD` matrix is defined as:

    .. math::

        ABCD =
            \\left[
            \\begin{array}{c|c}
              A & B \\\\ \\hline
              C & D
            \\end{array}
            \\right].

    The matrices :math:`A`, :math:`B`, :math:`C` and :math:`D` define the
    evolution of a generic linear discrete time invariant system under study
    through the state-space representation:

    .. math::

        x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)

    .. math::

        y(k) = Cx(k) + Du(k)

    The matrices are:

    * :math:`A` is the state matrix, dimensions :math:`(n, n)`, :math:`n` being
      the number of states in the system,

    * :math:`B` is the input matrix, dimensions :math:`(n, m)`, :math:`m` being
      the number of inputs in the system,

    * :math:`C` is the output matrix, dimensions :math:`(r, n)`, :math:`r`
      being the number of outputs in the system,

    * :math:`D` is the feedthrough matrix, dimensions :math:`(r, m)`.

    The vectors are:

    * :math:`x(k)` the state sequence, of length :math:`n`,

    * :math:`u(k)`, the input sequence, of length :math:`m`, and

    * :math:`y(k)` is the output sequence, of length :math:`r`.

    **Parameters:**

    ABCD: ndarray
       The ABCD matrix to be partitioned

    m: int, optional
       The number of inputs in the system. It will be calculated from the ABCD matrix,
       if not provided.

    r: int, optional
       The number of outputs in the system. It will be calculated from ``m`` and the
       ABCD matrix, if not provided.

    **Returns:**

    A, B, C, D: tuple of ndarrays
                The partitioned matrices.
